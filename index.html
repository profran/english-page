    <h1>Hayao Miyazaki, 宮崎 駿</h1>
    <h2 id="anime">What is Anime?</h2>
    <p>
      To start talking about Hayao Miyazaki, we first need to know what “Anime” is.
      Anime is a hand-drawn and computer animation originated in japan. However, The word
      Anime is the Japanese term for animation. Outside japan, anime refers specifically to
      animation from Japan, characterized by colorful graphics, vibrant characters and fantastical
      themes.
      One of the key points that made anime different from a handful of the western cartoons is the
      potential for visceral content. Once the expectation that the aspects of animation being just
      for children is put aside, the audience can realize that themes involving violence, suffering,
      sexuality, pain, and death can all be storytelling elements utilized in anime as much as other
      types of media.</p>
    <h2 id="biography">Hayao Miyazaki in Ghibli</h2>
    <p>Hayao Miyazaki, who was born in January 5 of 1941, is a Japanese film director, producer,
      screenwriter, animator, author and manga (oriental comics) artist. He has attained
      international acclaim as a masterful storyteller and as a maker of anime feature films, and is
      widely regarded as one of the greatest animation directors.
      Miyazaki co-founded studio Ghibli in 1985. He directed multiple films with Ghibli, including
      “Castle in the Sky”, “My Neighbor Totoro”, “Kiki’s Delivery Service”, among others. The films
      were met with commercial and critical success in Japan. Miyazaki’s film “Princess Mononoke”
      was the first animated film to win the Japan Academy Prize for Picture of the Year, and briefly
      became the highest-grossing film in Japan.
      Its distribution to the Western world greatly increased Ghibli's popularity and influence
      outside Japan. His 2001 film “Spirited Away” became the highest-grossing film in Japanese
      history, winning the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature at the 75th Academy Awards
      and considered among the greatest films of the decade. Miyazaki's later films—Howl's Moving
      Castle, Ponyo, and The Wind Rises—also enjoyed critical and commercial success. Following
      the release of The Wind Rises, Miyazaki announced his retirement from feature films, though
      he returned to work on a new feature film in 2016.
      Miyazaki's works are characterized by the recurrence of themes such as humanity's
      relationship with nature and technology, the wholesomeness of natural and traditional
      patterns of living, the importance of art and craftsmanship, and the difficulty of maintaining a
      pacifist ethic in a violent world. The protagonists of his films are often strong girls or young
      women, and several of his films present morally ambiguous antagonists with redeeming
      qualities. Miyazaki's works have been highly praised and awarded; he was named a Person of
      Cultural Merit for outstanding cultural contributions in November 2012, and received the
      Academy Honorary Award for his impact on animation and cinema in November 2014. In 2002,American film critic Roger Ebert suggested that Miyazaki may be the best animation filmmaker
      in history, praising the depth and artistry of his films.</p>
